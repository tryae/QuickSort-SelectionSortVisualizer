# About the Program
This is a visualization for both the quick sort and selection sort algorithms. Seeing the algorithms work in real time may make understanding them eaiser. All code is heavily commented to make understanding how i programmed them basic if you are new to each of the algorithms.

# requirement
Install ***pygame*** if you don't already have it! The easiest way is through command prompt you can type either of the two below.
<br>
pip install pygame **or** pip3 install pygame
<br>
copy and paste if you want and if that doesn't work make sure your pip is working properly.

## Controls
they are written in the application.<br> W- selection sort, E- quicksort, S- shuffle

***note -*** Spamming buttons might cause freezing, pygame has a tendency to crash under long lasting computative processing. It is very rare but keep that in mind when using.
